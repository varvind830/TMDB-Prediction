# TMDb-Box-Office-Prediction

## Project Overview
This is the final project for my "Intro to Machine Learning Course" - It includes predictions based on several attributes using linear regression and pipelines.

## Task
This project aims to predict movie revenues for movies in The Movie Database (TMDb). Included are examples of feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing/cleaning, and evaluation of our models. I've only included phase 3 of the project as it encompasses all of the work done in parts 1 and 2.

## Programs & Packages
- **Python**: Version 3.7
- **Packages**: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib
